# Prime Number Generator

I am learning rust so i kind of want to try some thing.
This prime number generator takes 3 inputs 
- low
- high
- count

  ### low
    It is the value from where we want to find prime numbers
  ### High
    It is the value up to where we want to find prime numbers

  so basically it generates primes from  [low-high)

  ### count
    No of thread to use
  (IDK the max thread that is supported)

A Final.txt file in created where all primes are stored
